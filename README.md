Task 2 - This task consists of predicting the Quality of red wine using Linear Regression.
Linear Regression is an algorithm that belongs to supervised Machine Learning. It tries to apply relations that will predict the outcome of an event based on the independent variable data points. The relation is usually a straight line that best fits the different data points as close as possible.
Linear regression is commonly used in many fields, including economics, finance, and social sciences, to analyze and predict trends in data. 


Task 3 - This task consists of classifying the Iris flower Species using K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.
The K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm is a popular machine learning technique used for classification and regression tasks. It relies on the idea that similar data points tend to have similar labels or values.
K is the number of nearest neighbors to use. For classification, a majority vote is used to determined which class a new observation should fall into.
